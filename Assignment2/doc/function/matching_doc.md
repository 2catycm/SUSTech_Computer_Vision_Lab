    This function does not need to be symmetric (e.g. it can produce
    different numbers of matches depending on the order of the arguments).

    To start with, simply implement the "ratio test", equation 4.18 in
    section 4.1.3 of Szeliski. There are a lot of repetitive features in
    these images, and all of their descriptors will look similar. The
    ratio test helps us resolve this issue (also see Figure 11 of David
    Lowe's IJCV paper).

    For extra credit you can implement various forms of spatial/geometric
    verification of matches, e.g. using the x and y locations of the features.
