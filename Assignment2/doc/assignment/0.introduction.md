**Assignment 2: Local Feature Matching**

**Overview**

The goal of this assignment is to create a local feature matching
algorithm using techniques described in Szeliski chapter 4.1. The
pipeline we suggest is a simplified version of the famous SIFT pipeline.
The matching pipeline is intended to work for instance-level matching
\-- multiple views of the same physical scene.

**Details**

> For this project, you need to implement the three major steps of a
> local feature matching algorithm:

-   Interest point detection in SID\<studentID\>\_harris.py (see
    > Szeliski 4.1.1)

-   Local feature description in SID\<studentID\>\_sift.py (see Szeliski
    > 4.1.2)

-   Feature Matching in SID\<studentID\>\_feature_matching.py (see
    > Szeliski 4.1.3)
