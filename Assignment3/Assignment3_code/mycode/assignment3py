# For this project, you will need to report performance for three
# combinations of features / classifiers. It is suggested you code them in
# this order, as well:
# 1. Tiny image features and nearest neighbor classifier
# 2. Bag of sift features and nearest neighbor classifier
# 3. Bag of sift features and linear SVM classifier
# 
# The starter code is initialized to 'placeholder' just so that the starter
# code does not crash when run unmodified and you can get a preview of how
# results are presented.

# ### Section 1a: Represent each image with the Tiny Image feature

# Each function to construct features should return an N x d numpy array, where N is the number of paths passed to the function and d is the dimensionality of each image representation. See the starter code for each function for more details.

# ### Section 1b: Classify each test image by training and using the Nearest Neighbor classifier
# 
# Each function to classify test features will return an N element list, where N is the number of test cases and each entry is a string indicating the predicted category for each test image. Each entry in 'predicted_categories' must be one of the 15 strings in 'categories', 'train_labels', and 'test_labels'. See the starter code for each function for more details.

# ### Section 1c: Build a confusion matrix and score the recognition system

# %% [markdown]
# (You do not need to code anything in this section.)
# 
# If we wanted to evaluate our recognition method properly we would train
# and test on many random splits of the data. You are not required to do so
# for this project.
# 
# This function will create a confusion matrix and various image
# thumbnails each time it is called. View the confusion matrix to help interpret
# your classifier performance. Where is it making mistakes? Are the
# confusions reasonable?
# 
# Interpreting your performance with 100 training examples per category:
# - accuracy  =   0 -> Your code is broken (probably not the classifier's fault! A classifier would have to be amazing to perform this badly).
# - accuracy ~= .07 -> Your performance is chance. Something is broken or you ran the starter code unchanged.
# - accuracy ~= .20 -> Rough performance with tiny images and nearest neighbor classifier. Performance goes up a few percentage points with K-NN instead of 1-NN.
# - accuracy ~= .20 -> Rough performance with tiny images and linear SVM classifier. The linear classifiers will have a lot of trouble trying to separate the classes and may be unstable (e.g. everything classified to one category)
# - accuracy ~= .50 -> Rough performance with bag of SIFT and nearest neighbor classifier. Can reach .60 with K-NN and different distance metrics.
# - accuracy ~= .60 -> You've gotten things roughly correct with bag of SIFT and a linear SVM classifier.
# - accuracy >= .70 -> You've also tuned your parameters well. E.g. number of clusters, SVM regularization, number of patches sampled when building vocabulary, size and step for dense SIFT features.
# - accuracy >= .80 -> You've added in spatial information somehow or you've added additional, complementary image features. This represents state of the art in Lazebnik et al 2006.
# - accuracy >= .85 -> You've done extremely well. This is the state of the art in the 2010 SUN database paper from fusing many  features. Don't trust this number unless you actually measure many random splits.
# - accuracy >= .90 -> You used modern deep features trained on much larger image databases.
# - accuracy >= .96 -> You can beat a human at this task. This isn't a realistic number. Some accuracy calculation is broken or your classifier is cheating and seeing the test labels.
